    <!--
    Important:
    Please read the NervousNet Security documentation and fully understand it before making any changes here, as it would impact the whole application's security and usage.
    Declare all Security settings here, which makes them global settings, such that all the Http calls will have same settings.
    Failure to do so might end up in using different certificate pools for different groups of calls, which could be very difficult to
    change in code, for every Security configuration or Certificate Type change.-->
